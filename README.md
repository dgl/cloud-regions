# Cloud provider regions

This is data on cloud provider regions, primarily aiming to give their
approximate location in a provider independent format.

## Providers

* Amazon, Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Azure, Microsoft Azure
* Google, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Linode
* Oracle
* Vultr

## Adding or updating data

The raw data is in data.csv in each provider's directory. Update that and send
a PR.

Most regions currently refer to a coarse area, such as "London". If you know
which datacentres a region is actually hosted in, we will happily take updates.

However there are cases where the parts (to use neutral terminology) of a
region are far apart, we may editorialise in those cases and pick a single
datacentre in a suitable midpoint. Sometimes the datacenters are actually
outside the declared "region" by the provider, that's fine.

## Adding a provider

Make a data.csv.

- "region" must match the region used in the API for the provider
- "location_name" ideally should match the description the provider uses
- "country_tld" should be the country code, with a bias towards the form used
  in TLDs (hk rather than cn, uk rather than gb)

The rest of the fields should be as: [./get-loc.sh](tools/get-loc.sh) "London,
England" outputs.

Make a "fetch-list" which can fetch a list of the current regions from the
providers API or other provider controlled source (sources without auth such as
IP lists are preferred). This makes it possible to regularly check for new
regions so the data stays fresh.

Explain in the README roughly how you did it, for when it comes time to update.

## Using the data

The raw data is in CSV in each provider's data.csv file.

In [tools/](tools) geojson.go can be used to convert the data into a GeoJSON
FeatureCollection.

```shell
$ go build -o geojson geojson.go
$ ./geojson ../*/data.csv > ../data.json
```
